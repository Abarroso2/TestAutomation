# Test Automation


Welcome to the Automation POC Challenge

To run the tests:

Navigate to the test folder desired, all the tests are using behave
so it's to easy to start then

You can choose run one by one (behave test_name.feature) or just 
type behave at the console into the features folder.
This action will be understood by the system as that you wanna run 
alll the tests.feature in that folder

It also should run at PyCharm.
But actualy it was made in vscode for linux

Debian Linux
